# Abstract

> Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are nowadays widely deployed and enable users to fetch the required content quickly from caches in CDNs. Quality of Experience (QoE) is a metric that expresses the subjective perception of users about services and immediately reflects user experience. However, existing works mainly concentrated on optimizing the cache hit rate of user requests and fails to consider QoE. In this paper, we introduce content fetching delay-based QoE to CDNs for rationally assigning requests and deploying content to caches. In particular, we first formulate the Optimal Object Cache Arrangement (OOCA) problem, which focuses on establishing the mapping between content requests and content caches to maximize the QoE of user requests, and then propose a QoE-aware heuristic caching algorithm named QoE-Cache to solve the OOCA problem. QoE-Cache primarily considers the QoE potential of objects based on a nonlinear decreasing relationship between QoE and content fetching delay and keeps sight of the size and popularity of objects. Simulation results based on real life industry CDN traces show that QoE-Cache outperforms hit rate-based caching algorithms by improving QoE by approximately 25% to 65% for the single cache and up to 80% for distributed cache, respectively.
